# School_District_Analaysis

# Overview

This Challenge was to help Maria deep dive into the question of academic integrity by doing a series of changes and analysis work for her. This includes formatting, grouping, and adjusting the School District Analysis's data to explicitly show whoever will read the data clear results of funding and school performance across the district. 

  # Results
  The analysis was actually conducted twice. First time, using the full student data. The Second, removing 9th grade students at Thomas High School. After the 9th graders were removed the data summary is pictured below.

    * Once the the 9th gaders math and reading scores were removed, the changes for Thomas High School were- 
      * The overall passing percentage for Thomas High School fell to 65%
      * The overall passing percentage for the entire district fell to 64.9%  
      * Thomas High School fell from the top 5 Schools
      
    * When the ninth graders' of Thomas High School had their scores omitted from the calculations, the following changes occured:
        * The overall passing percentages of Thomas High School decreased by 0.11%
        * The average scores of Thomas High School for math and reading increased by 0.06
        * For the spending range of $630-644 per student, the overall passing percentage decreased by 0.1%
        * School rankings are unchanged. Thomas High School is still the second best performing school in the district with an overall passing rate of 
        90.63% among their tenth through twelfth graders.
        
  # The correlation between Average Scores and School Size
    With the results found in the photo below, there is no significant correlation in spending per student and grade scores. It is safe to say spending that as spending pre student increases, it does not increase average test scores of passing percents.

  # Charter vs District

 Its a traditional assumption that charter schools outperform public, in this case District, Schools. In this case, with this data. That assumption stands. The top five best performing schools were charter schools and acccoriding to the data, charter schools had a 36% higher passing percent in comparision to District Schools. 
 
 # Summary
 With the data set presented, it is not very clear in determining the extent of academic dishonesty. An investigation is suggested at Thomas High School because with the removal of Thomas High School 9th graders data, the missing results caused passing percentages amd average scores to fall. With such a drastic change in data from 1 grade level at one school, which seemed to carry the high scores, it is a red flag to investigate the academic integrity of Thomas High School 9th graders.
