# School_District_Analaysis

# Overview

This Challenge was to help Maria deep dive into the question of academic integrity by doing a series of changes and analysis work for her. This includes formatting, grouping, and adjusting the School District Analysis's data to explicitly show whoever will read the data clear results of funding and school performance across the district. 

  # Results
  The analysis was actually conducted twice. First time, using the full student data. The Second, removing 9th grade students at Thomas High School. After the 9th graders were removed the data summary is pictured below.
